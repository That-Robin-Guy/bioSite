                <h1>Stephen Switzer</h1>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    
                    In 1984, a few weeks before the revolutionary Macintosh personal computer was released by Apple 
                    Computer Inc, another revolutionary event took place. On January 12 of that year, a baby boy was born 
            by the name of Stephen Switzer. Born in a quaint hospital in the small town of Pascagoula, Mississippi, 
            his parents would bring the young Stephen home to Grand Bay, Alabama roughly a month later. The 
            town of Grand Bay sits between the Mississippi state line and the much bigger city of Mobile. 
            Stephen’s earliest memory was not a happy one. At 3 years old, his dad’s mom suffering from 
            Parkinson’s disease passed away in little Stephen’s bed. The details he recalls of the ordeal are few, but 
            he does remember how different everyone acted after her death. </p>
                <p>Stephen’s hobbies he partakes in as an adult has roots to his childhood. His dad loved to use his
            woodworking skills to build things. Stephen was so enamored with the process and always wanted to 
            help in any way he could. As an adult Stephen built himself an entertainment center, a coffee table, and 
            added a deck to his house just to name a few. “If I look at something and think I would like to have that 
            or make that... I see how I can make it happen.” he states. </p>
            <p>His creativity goes beyond just woodworking though. Halloween was always one of his favorite holidays 
            as a kid. He loved the idea of dressing up and being someone completely different. After attending a 
            ComiCon-like event in Atlanta Georgia, called DragonCon, his love of cosplay exploded. Since then, he 
            has made several cosplay outfits from scratch. The most notable being a Spiderman/Captain America 
            hybrid. It consisted of a Spiderman suit in Captain America’s color scheme (red, white, and blue). It also 
            came with Captain America’s shield that displayed a spider at the center of it. When asked why he 
            makes all his cosplay costumes instead of purchasing them outright he states “My wants and desires 
            exceed the boundaries of my checking account. “ </p>
            <p>One last hobby of Stephen’s that arose from childhood was his love of video games. One of his favorite 
            games was called Final Fantasy 7, an epic story-driven role-playing game. The game was released in 
            1997 and won numerous awards that year. The game has been selected as the top game of all time by 
            many gaming publications.</p>
            <p>Stephen graduated college from the University of South Alabama with a Psychology degree in 2009 and 
            an accounting degree in 2013. He currently resides in Daphne, AL where he works remotely as a third-party administrator for a 401K company. </p>
