                    <h1>Hobbies</h1>
                <div class="paragraph">
                <p>Over 2,000 thousand years ago, woodworking was a vital part of society for people across the globe at 
                    that time. Today it is one of the most popular hobbies for those searching for a creative outlet. Creative 
                    hobbies come with all sorts of benefits. They can greatly increase your self-esteem and confidence. 
                    They are a great way of relieving stress. They provide excellent ways to meet new people. Most people 
                    find hobbies of a creative nature incredibly fascinating to talk about. </p>
                
                 <p>  Woodworking specifically has its own set of benefits. It is a great way to express yourself whether 
                    youâ€™re building furniture, upgrading spaces in your home, or creating things for purely artistic purposes. 
                    Working with wood can help save you money. Additionally, it can be a great source of income.</p>

                    <p>
                        The first image on the left is a coffee table Stephen created from scratch last year. The whole process took about 3 weeks to complete, including adding the lift feature.  It is one of the things Stephen is most proud of creating.
                        On the homepage, there is an image of a deck attached to the back side of his house.  He also built this by hand, as well. <i> (I helped a little bit.) </i>
                    </p>

                 <p>   Cosplay is a term that stands for Costume Play. It is a performance art in which the participants dress in 
                    costumes and make-up, representing characters from anime, video games, television and film. In 
                    addition to creating authentic costumes, the cosplayers also act as the characters they are dressed in.
                    They usually have a passion for the subject matter of the characters for which they are replicating. 
                    Cosplay is also another great way to express yourself. It also allows one to show a great amount of 
                    creativity. Especially when cosplayers mesh two or more elements from different pieces of 
                    entertainment into one costume. Because cosplayers often love to share their creations it is a great way 
                    to meet people who have similar interests. </p> 

                <p>
                    The second picture on the left side is another creation of Stephen's.  He used two different characters as inspiration to create this cosplay outfit.  He used the superhero, Spiderman, as a base and adding elements of 
                    Captain America.  Additionally, he created a cosplay of Princess Bean from the Netflix show Disenchantment this year for his trip to DragonCon.

                <p>    Since the 1980s, video gaming has become a popular way to pass the time for a lot of people. They 
                    can provide some benefits as well. They can increase mind/hand reaction times. They encourage 
                    teamwork. Playing video games can stimulate creativity, focus and visual memory. They also can help 
                    players learn critical thinking skills.

                <p>
                    The last image to the left is the original Playstation disc cover for the game, Final Fantasy 7, one of Stephen's favorite video games of all time.
