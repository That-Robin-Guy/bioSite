                 <p>   Cosplay is a term that stands for Costume Play. It is a performance art in which the participants dress in 
                    costumes and make-up, representing characters from anime, video games, television and film. In 
                    addition to creating authentic costumes, the cosplayers also act as the characters they are dressed in.

                    creativity. Especially when cosplayers mesh two or more elements from different pieces of 
                    entertainment into one costume. Because cosplayers often love to share their creations it is a great way 
                    to meet people who have similar interests. </p>
